_**This part is a introduction about Linux and shell.**_

What is _**Linux**_ ? It is a open source system build by thousands of developers. I guss you frequently used system is Windows. Don't be afraid, Linux is not too difficult to use. We use Ubuntu which is the most popular Linux Release,and it is basd on Debian.

At first, you should know about that the desktop is not all of the Linux. Even if Ubuntu has a friendly desktop, but some many work esay use in shell. So, don't rely on desktop and start to lean how to use the shell will make it easy to control your Ubuntu. Of couse, you can use a Linux waht you want, but we show you it in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS(even thought it isn't stable at all).

## Linux file systems

In Linux, all files and directory be organized a file system which like a tree's root. The file systems begin the top from Root directory. The Root directory include all files and directory.And also,the directory include other files and directory.The root directory is important. all files and directory mount on it. The Home directory is also one of the most improtant directory and you should know about it. It is a directory where you can save your personal files.We have so much directory in Linux file systems,but you must should know about table list when you first meeting Linux:

**Table about the common Linux file systems**

| Directory | Description |
| :---      | :---                                               |
| /         | The first layer file system and the Root directory |
| /home     | User's home directory.include saved files and personal sitting |
| /usr      | It is a improtant directory, all your programes in it, like the "program file" in Windows |
| /etc      | This directory is include Linux system file and config file |

Like the name shell, _**Shell**_ is the shell of Linux. The core for Linux is _**Kernel**_. Shell is the way to control the Linux and return the Kernel's messages back. If you had used the _**DOS**_ in windows before , you will be easy to use the Shell in Linux.

In Ubuntu, you can use the sofware _**Terminal**_ to make the Shell work on Linux. I will tell you some tips about Shell. At the first, you can find Terminal (find it in app center or use the hot ksey "Ctrl+Alt+T") and enter the next code in it for test: `pwd`

It will return where directory where you are on screen. Like:`/home/rotation`

We need more example to show how you should use command in Terminal: You can creat a directory and it own by yourself, Like that `mkdir`. Just run `mkdir test`, now you get a directory which named test. You can use `cd` to enter a directory. Like that `cd test` In Shell world, you should know what the mean of `.` and `..`. The `.` is mean your now directory. The `..` is mean the upper directory. If you want back the upper directory, you can run `cd ..` in Terminal.

If you want know more about your running command, please add command `man` before the command ,like `man mkdir`. Also you can add `-h or -help` to    see the help by developer.

In [next part](https://github.com/HDsky/Linux/blob/master/command.md), you can see a list of command you often use.
